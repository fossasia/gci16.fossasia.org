# Adding a mentor

To add a mentor open the file `mentors.yml` in `_data` folder and please maintain the following format *EXACTLY* (replacing values where indicated):

```yaml
- name: Mentor's name
  github: Mentor's github username
  image: mentor's_image
  twitter: Mentor's twitter id
  facebook: Mentor's facebook id
  lat: Mentor's latitude
  lng: Mentor's longitude
```

**IMPORTANT:**

- All images must be optimized before uploaded to the repo via commit or PR. You may use any image optimizer of your choice.
- The images should be 240 x 240 pixels.
- Adding Facebook, Twitter, Github, etc. is not obliged. But if you do not want to include social media accounts, please do not provide empty fields like `facebook:`. Ask the mentors if you do not know their accounts.
- If you do not know the mentors' location, ask them to go to the official FOSSASIA geolocation website <https://fossasia.github.io/geolocation> and give you their latitude and longitude.
- Avoid using contractions such as *can't, don't,* etc. If there is no choice (e.g. the name has single quote mark) put double quotes (`"`) around that part.
- Try to use abbreviations in your name wherever possible, i.e. restrict it to 13 letters (including spaces), otherwise it might be truncated automatically. However, the name will be displayed completely when you hover on it on the website.
