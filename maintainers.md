Maintainers
===========

You can view a [team of maintainers for repository](https://github.com/orgs/fossasia/teams/gci16-maintainers).

Responsibilities of Maintainers
-------------------------------

- Do not frustrate contributors: Find out what they need, help them help themselves.
- Guide new contributors. They usually do not comply to the rules and forcing them onto them can be frustrating.
- Be empathic: Better a bad PR with follow-up PRs than a closed PR and a rejected person.
- Merge pull-requests.
- Make sure people understand that you can not accept their GCI task.

Not a responsibilty of a maintainer
-----------------------------------

- review pull-requests: Anyone can do this, it does not need a maintainer.
- reject pull-requests:
  - Just do not merge them if you do not like them.
  - If they get old, they are closed.
  - Merge them and revert them to make the requester to a contributor in the future.

Abilities of Maintainers
------------------------

- Close old pull-requests, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Remove merged branches.
