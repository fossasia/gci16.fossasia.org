    <p>Hello there! Thank you for passing by!</p>

<p>Today I will be talking about my decision of choosing FOSSASIA as the
 organization to work with in the Google Code-In contest, and what this
participation means to me.</p>

<p>I had found out about this contest from someone’s T-shirt at a 
programming summer camp. By that time, I had only had 12 years, so I 
hadn’t been eligible to participate yet, never mind the absence of 
experience and knowledge. Fast forward 4 years later, in 2015, I felt 
confident enough to join, with my only goal being the earning of a 
T-shirt. By the end of the contest, though, I also gained tons of 
knowledge and experience, for which I’m grateful up to this very moment.
 But that couldn’t have happened without the wonderful community that 
forms FOSSASIA.</p>

<p>So what is FOSSASIA?</p>

<p>FOSSASIA is an organization established in 2009, whose main objective
 is supporting open source technology. FOSSASIA’s community is formed of
 developers who work on open source projects (web applications, mobile 
applications and many many more), but also of designers and contributors
 who wish to see a better future for people’s lives everywhere around 
the globe. Besides that, they are the host of many <a href="http://events.fossasia.org/">events</a>,
 summits, and programming contests that bring together people from all 
continents so they can create, develop, and share their work with the 
open source community. Why not pay a visit to their <a href="https://fossasia.org/">website</a>?</p>

<p>What is open source?</p>

<p>I previously mentioned open source many times, so what is that? Open 
source refers to a program in which the source code is freely available 
to everyone for use and modification. In this way, open source creates 
many communities across the globe who develop and contribute to computer
 programs free for everyone, thus bringing more people together.</p>

<p>I chose to continue my work with FOSSASIA at 2016’s Google Code-In 
contest, because this community welcomed me with warmth, taught me a lot
 about open source, and helped me experiment with technologies 
previously unknown to me. I remember I once claimed a task about writing
 a <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> tutorial, and then I 
realized there are many aspects of it that I know nothing about, and 
that is how I learned a lot about it. I found FOSSASIA’s tasks the most 
fun and also the most suitable for me. I enjoy web development, Python 
and mobile apps development, and this organizations had just what I was 
looking for. Below are some of the repositories I’m interested in the 
most, go check them out!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/loklak_search">Loklak Search</a> - social media search server, collecting messages from various sources</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-orga-server">Open Event</a> - open event organizer server, for managing events</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/susi_android">Susi AI</a> - chat application, implementing AI, data science and machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p>Their work doesn’t stop here, as they are continuously developing new
 apps and tools that people from all continents benefit from.</p>

<p>I’m trying to contribute as much as I can. So far, I have practiced 
many of my skills, not only in development, but also in git, especially 
by helping other students. As soon as I can, I’ll start working on more 
challenging tasks, especially Python ones, in order to build a solid 
foundation that will definitely help me in the future.</p>

<p>To conclude, I’m looking forward to the start of our Christmas 
vacation, so I have more time to contribute and help others, and I hope 
that in the future I will be able to join this contest again…as a 
mentor!</p>
