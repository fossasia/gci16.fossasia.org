                                             <p>FOSSASIA is a non-profit
 organization supporting developers and makers of Free and Open Source 
technologies. It was founded by Hong Phuc Dang and Mario Behling. The 
aim of FOSSASIA is to develop and adapt open technologies for social 
change with a focus on Asian users. The FOSSASIA Summit takes place 
annually one month after the Lunar New Year. Projects at FOSSASIA range

whenever i got in any of the tasks i got an an almost instant help and 
advice from mentors and fossasia's awesome community. Wheather you stuck
 at merging your git repository's branches or getting an error while 
deploying an docker app to cloud, you will get help regardless of on 
what you are working on.

                                             <p>while working on the 
tasks given by fossasia , i luckily got my hands on lok_lak server and 
open event web app. I found these projects extremely facinating and was 
very excited to test it. I even collected 340,000 messages/tweets using 
lok_lak server deployed on google cloud and 220,000 while it was 
deployed locally. Next comes the Open event web app, it has a generator 
which generates an event listing website when given a zip file having 
your info in JSON format. I have explained both the apps along with 
their github repo link below. check that out:<br><br></p>

                                        <p>loklak is a server 
application which is able to collect messages from various sources, 
including twitter. The server contains a search index and a peer-to-peer
 index sharing interface. All messages are stored in an elasticsearch 
index. An automatic deployment from the development branch at GitHub is 
available for tests <a href="https://loklak-server-dev.herokuapp.com/">here</a>

'Lok Lak' is also a very tasty Cambodian stir-fry meat dish (usually 
beef) with a LOT of fresh black pepper. If you ever have the chance to 
eat Beef Lok Lak, please try it. I hope not to scare vegetarians with 
this name, currently I am one as well.

                                        <p>The loklak_search creates a 
website using the loklak server as a data source. The goal is to get a 
search site, that offers timeline search as well as custom media search,
 account and geolocation search.</p>

<p>In order to run the service you can use the API of <a href="http://api.loklak.org/">http://api.loklak.org</a>
 or install your own loklak server data storage engine. loklak_server is
 a server application which collects messages from various social media 
tweet sources, including twitter. The server contains a search index and
 a peer-to-peer index sharing interface. All messages are stored in an 
elasticsearch index.</p>

<p>A sample site of this repo is deployed on the GitHub gh-pages branch and automatically deployed <a href="http://loklak.fossasia.org/">here</a>:                                        </p>

The Open Event Web App project has two components a) an event website generator and b) the actual generated website output.

                                        <p>The web generator application
 can generate event websites by getting data from event JSON files and 
binary media files, that are stored in a compressed zip file. You can 
also access the application through a REST API. Websites that are 
generated by the "web app generator" can be uploaded to any web 
location, e.g. on Github pages or any server (e.g. via ftp).

 from this organisation but after doing their tasks i feel i am 
confident enough to say i am definitely learning about open source. So 
far it has been a great experience but i am craving for more and could 
not sit idle :P FOSSASIA is a great organisation, you should join it too
 :) </p>
