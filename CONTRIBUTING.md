## Code practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor.
We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

* [People before code](http://hintjens.com/blog:95): If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.

* Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: `Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors/blogs section`.

* Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the pattern ``` Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>```

* Provide the link to live `gh-pages` from your forked repository or relevant screenshot for easier review.

* The PR should also include a link to the Google Code-In Task instance (if applicable) to fasten the review process both sides.

* In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author should squash them.

* Pull Request older than 4 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.

* Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.
